# KLRN Corporate Support microsite  

This is a microsite targeting sponsors interested in connecting with KLRN viewers through on-air messaging, event sponsorships or other marketing channels.  

This site uses PHP 7 to slice HTML into templates, manage navigation state, and validate and send SMTP emails through a remote server from a contact form. 

The email application uses the PHPMailer library (see link under References), which isn't included in this repository. The front-end HTML, CSS and JavaScript is built using Bootsrap 4 in an npm workflow (see link below) that contenates and compresses the CSS and JavaScript.
